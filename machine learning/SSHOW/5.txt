It has become a common affair for cities people. It has created a 
deplorable condition in our regular life. There are many causes of traffic jams. Increasing the number of buses, 
trucks, autorickshaws, rickshaws are the main causes of traffic jams. Overpopulation is also a cause.All classes of people are the victim by it. On the other hand, the traffic control system 
in our country is not developed. There have insufficient traffic police. 
Our government should establish more plans to 
solve the problem.

Adhoc mode:
In adhoc mode,each node communicates directly with other nodes, so no access point control is needed.
Nodes in adhoc can communicate if they are within the same range.
Most adhoc based WLAn uses Connection MAC protocols(e.g.CSMA).
Bluetooth is a typical Adhoc network.
No physicall infrastructure is needed.

Infrastructure mode:
In infrastructure mode, the communication occurs only between the wireless access point(AP),
but not directly between wireless modes.
Access point act as a bridge to other wireless or wired network.
Most infrastructure based WLAN uses TDMA based protocols.
IEEE 802.11 & HiperLANs are based in Infrastructure mode.
